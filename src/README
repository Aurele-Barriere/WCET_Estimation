WCET estimation,
with Abstract Interpretation and Constraint Programming

The code consists in several ocaml modules.
The following modules :
    - wcetCsp.ml
    - wcetKirchhoff.ml
    - wcetToConstraints.ml
are designed to produce constraints with the syntax of AbSolute. These can be changed to use another Solver but must keep the same signature.
Moreover, the file estimate.sh, that executes the whole method, depends on AbSolute and Interproc. It must be changed to use another Solver or another Abstract Interpreter.

How to use :
Type 'make' to create the executable wcetAnalysis.
You can type 'make clean' to clean all intermediate files (.cmo, .cmx, .cmi) or 'make cleanall' to also remove the executable.
Type 'sh estimate.sh' to estimate the WCET of the programm in the input file.
Type 'sh clean.sh' to remove all intermediate files (.csp). The final optimization problem will be kept.
